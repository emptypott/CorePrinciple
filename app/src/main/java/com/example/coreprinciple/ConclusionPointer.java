    // Of all the misconceptions about the Java Programming language, this is the most egregious.

    // Far from not having pointers, object-oriented programming is conducted in the Java Programming language

    // exclusively with pointers. In other words, objects are only ever accessed through pointers,

    // never directly.

    // The pointers are termed "references" and they are automatically dereferenced for you.

    // "An Object is class instance or an array. The reference values (often just references) are

    // pointers to the objects"

    // Java Language Specification, section 4.3.1. emphasis is in the original text

    // Any book that claims Java does not have pointers is inconsistent with the Java reference specification.
